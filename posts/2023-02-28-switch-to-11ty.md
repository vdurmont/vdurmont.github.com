After years without publishing anything here, my recent adventures at [Lightspark](https://www.lightspark.com) made me want to write some things again.

Every time I want to write, the procrastinating part of my brain takes over and I _need_ to cleanup whatever blog software I'm using. Initially, I managed to resist it, but my previous engine, Jekyll was completely outdated. Nothing could be built anymore, upgrading was a super big pain because none of the plugins I used we working and I don't ~~like~~ know Ruby.

So instead of doing something simple and just write some content, I started the far more attractive complex task of rebuilding this website. After some research, I found [this new fancy 11ty ("eleventy") framework](https://www.11ty.dev/) that is supposed to be a replacement for Jekyll in javascript. I like Javascript, so I went for it.

And... it was really easy. I only spent a couple of hours on it when I was fully prepared to stay up all night battling the Javascript gods.

10/10. Strongly recommend.

The only tricky part was to get it to publish properly to Github Pages. I had to change the output directory in the `.eleventy.js` config file to:

```js
module.exports = function (eleventyConfig) {
  // Other stuff

  return {
    dir: {
      output: "docs",
    },
  };
};
```

Then in my Github Pages config, I went to:

```txt
https://github.com/{organization}/{repository}/settings/pages
```

and changed the directory to `/docs`. Github is pretty limited and only accepts `/` or `/docs` as a directory to serve pages content ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Hopefully, I'll be able to write something soon. But not today. Today, I rebuilt my website.
