<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
	I was born in France and I currently live in Los Angeles with my family, after
	I spent about 10 years in the San Francisco Bay Area.
</p>
<p>
	I'm a full stack developer, which means I know just enough to be dangerous
	everywhere.
</p>
<p>
	In the past few years, I have been enjoying the fintech world and the crypto
	industry, first at
	<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/05/welcome-to-novi/">Novi</a>, and now
	at <a href="https://www.lightspark.com/">Lightspark</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Before that, I spent a few years at
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>, working on their internal
	tools, both as an IC and a manager. I also worked at/founded several startups,
	including <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mindie">Mindie</a>,
	<a href="https://www.ubleam.com">Ubleam</a>, and
	<a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/plixee">Plixee</a>.
