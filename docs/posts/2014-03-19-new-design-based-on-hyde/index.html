<h1 class="blog-title">New design based on Hyde</h1>
<p>I just refreshed the design of this site for something more colorful. The theme was inspired by <a href="http://hyde.getpoole.com">Hyde</a>, a delightful Jekyll theme by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a>.</p>
<p>I didn't fork directly the Hyde project because I wanted to dive in the less code to experiment some new concepts. Basing my structure on something made by one of the creator of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> is a good way to learn ;)</p>
<p>The points I wanted to explore were mainly:</p>
<ul>
<li>The media queries: how to adapt my layout and my design to the different devices.</li>
<li>The less code structure: how to organize my code.</li>
<li>The less mixins: how to create useful functions that can be reused across the stylesheets.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I was learning how to do that, I found the <a href="http://mdo.github.io/code-guide/">Code Guide by @mdo</a>. It contains a great amount of useful recommendations on how to write and organise your code. Check it out!</p>
<p>If you want to take a look at the code of this blog, you can <a href="https://github.com/vdurmont/vdurmont.github.com">find it on github</a>.</p>
