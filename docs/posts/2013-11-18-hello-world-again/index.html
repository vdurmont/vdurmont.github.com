<h1 class="blog-title">Hello World, again!</h1>
<p>Hi everyone, I'm back!</p>
<p>It's been a long time since I posted something on the internet!</p>
<p>Between the end of my studies at INSA, my startup experience at Plixee, my relocation in <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/LwIkY">Toulouse</a> and the fact that I started working for <a href="http://ubleam.com">Ubleam</a>, it's been an exciting but dense couple of years!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Whether it is at work or during my spare time, and I spend a lot of time learning and testing new technologies and frameworks. I open this blog to share some of my findings.</p>
<p>The technologies you can expect to read about soon are Java, Spring Framework, Node.js, Angular.js, occasionaly some mobile (iOS/Android) development and even some snippets of Python or Ruby ;)</p>
<p>I'm particularly interested in understanding and digging into the REST APIs and the service oriented web so I will give you some feedback on the patterns I use and some implementations I have coded.</p>
<p>Finally, I love entrepreurship and I try to keep up to date with the ecosystem (french and international) and the latest revelations ;)</p>
<p>I hope you will like what you will find here! You can subscribe to the <a href="/rss/posts.xml">RSS feed</a> of this blog and/or follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/Dvins">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://github.com/vdurmont">Github</a>!</p>
<p>See you soon!</p>
