title: New design based on Hyde
---

I just refreshed the design of this site for something more colorful. The theme was inspired by <a href="http://hyde.getpoole.com">Hyde</a>, a delightful Jekyll theme by <a href="https://twitter.com/mdo">@mdo</a>.

I didn't fork directly the Hyde project because I wanted to dive in the less code to experiment some new concepts. Basing my structure on something made by one of the creator of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a> is a good way to learn ;)

The points I wanted to explore were mainly:

* The media queries: how to adapt my layout and my design to the different devices.
* The less code structure: how to organize my code.
* The less mixins: how to create useful functions that can be reused across the stylesheets.

When I was learning how to do that, I found the [Code Guide by @mdo](http://mdo.github.io/code-guide/). It contains a great amount of useful recommendations on how to write and organise your code. Check it out!
