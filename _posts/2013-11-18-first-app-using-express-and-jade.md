title: Your first app with Node.js, Express.js and Jade

At Ubleam, I often need to prototype small webapps for our clients. The goal is to create a specific product in the shortest possible period of time in order to test the market on a feature.

I choose not to integrate those apps directly in our main API because it would require too much work to meet the quality of service I expect: response times, stress tests, graphic integration in our services, etc. I prefer to build small and flexible apps and invest time and efforts to integrate them when we feel the market is ready.

I often develop those apps on a Node.js base because it's an easy way to get tangible results in a very short time. In this post, I will show you how to set up a basic webapp using Node.js, Express.js and Jade.

# Technologies

Let's start with a quick presentation of the technologies used in this post:

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) is a platform built on top of Chrome javascript engine which provides a simple way to build javascript apps on the server side.
* [Express.js](http://expressjs.com) is a lightweigth and flexible framework providing an easy way to build node-based web applications.
* [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) is a template engine built for node for producing XML/HTML files. It provides an indentation-based clean and readable syntax, along with a few helpers and filters.

# Requirements

In order to make the following code work, you must have installed `node` and `npm` on your computer.

# Set up a basic express app

To start with, create a `package.json` file. It describes your app and its dependencies:

	{
		"name": "MyApp",
		"version": "0.0.1",
		"private": true,
		"dependencies": {
			"express": "3.4.4"
		}
	}

Then create your main javascript file `app.js`. After importing express, this file creates an app and listens to get requests on the path `/`. We also give the possibility to provide a `name` query parameter in order to personalize our response.

	var express = require('express');
	var app = express();

	app.get('/', function(req, res){
		var name  = req.query.name != null ? req.query.name : "World";
		res.send('Hello, '+name+'!');
	});

	app.listen(3333);
	console.log('Running on port 3333!');



Simply run `npm install && node app.js` and open a browser to [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333).

You can also try with a parameter [http://localhost:3333?name=Vincent](http://localhost:3333?name=Vincent).

# Add Jade template engine

The previous page is quite awesome but we can do better ;)  
Imagine that the parameter is a database id and that the page would entirely change its content according to the given id.
We could write HTML in the response but our code would quickly become ugly. That's when Jade rescues us!

Jade provides us a really simple way to write our HTML page template and to inject an object with our variables.

Let's add Jade to our dependencies:

	{
		"name": "MyApp",
		"version": "0.0.1",
		"private": true,
		"dependencies": {
			"express": "3.4.4",
			"jade": "0.35.0"
		}
	}

(Don't forget to run `npm install` to update the dependencies!)

We can now update our `app.js` file to indicate that express has now to use jade as a template engine.

We also render a different page according to the presence or the lack of the `name` parameter.

	var express = require('express');
	var app = express();

	// Jade
	app.set('views', __dirname+'/views');
	app.set('view engine', 'jade');

	app.get('/', function(req, res){
		var name = req.query.name;
		if (name == null)
			res.render('world', {
				title: "MyApp for the world",
				date: new Date()
			});
		else
			res.render('user', {
				title: "MyApp for the you",
				name: name,
				reversedName: name.split("").reverse().join("")
			});
	});

	app.listen(3333);
	console.log('Running on port 3333!');

We created 3 jade files in the `views` directory. `layout.jade` contains the common structure and styles of the app. `world.jade` and `user.jade` extend the layout and define a specific content.

	doctype html5
	html
		head
			title #{title}
			link(rel="stylesheet", href="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.2/css/bootstrap.min.css")
		body
			div.container(style="max-width: 800px;")
				h1 My sample app
				block content

				footer(style="text-align:center;")
					p Copyright Â© MyApp

&nbsp;

	extends layout

	block content
		p Hello again World.
		p The current date is: #{date}
		p.
			Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod
			tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam,
			quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo
			consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse
			cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non
			proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

&nbsp;

	extends layout

	block content
		p Happy to see you again, #{name} !
		p I'm happy to show your reversed name: <strong>#{reversedName}</strong>!

You will now get the following page:

For [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333):

# Going further

As you can see, setting up a webapp using node, express and jade is really quick and easy. From this point, it is possible to create a website to test any web feature you may have to experiment.

Obviously, this post described a really basic example. There is so much more to see and I would start with:

* Diving a little deeper in Jade syntax,
* Getting a look at Stylus which is the Jade equivalent for CSS
* Adding database support to our express app
* Handling the errors in express
* Etc.
