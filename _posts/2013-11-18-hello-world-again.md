Hi everyone, I'm back!

It's been a long time since I posted something on the internet!

Between the end of my studies at INSA, my startup experience at Plixee, my relocation in [Toulouse](http://goo.gl/maps/LwIkY) and the fact that I started working for [Ubleam](http://ubleam.com), it's been an exciting but dense couple of years! 

<!--more-->

Whether it is at work or during my spare time, and I spend a lot of time learning and testing new technologies and frameworks. I open this blog to share some of my findings.

The technologies you can expect to read about soon are Java, Spring Framework, Node.js, Angular.js, occasionaly some mobile (iOS/Android) development and even some snippets of Python or Ruby ;)

I'm particularly interested in understanding and digging into the REST APIs and the service oriented web so I will give you some feedback on the patterns I use and some implementations I have coded.

Finally, I love entrepreurship and I try to keep up to date with the ecosystem (french and international) and the latest revelations ;)

I hope you will like what you will find here! You can subscribe to the [RSS feed](/rss/posts.xml) of this blog and/or follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/Dvins) and [Github](http://github.com/vdurmont)!

See you soon!
