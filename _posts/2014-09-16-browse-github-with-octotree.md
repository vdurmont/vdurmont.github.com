title: Browse Github with octotree
---

I recently discovered a **very** useful chrome plugin called [Octotree](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/octotree/bkhaagjahfmjljalopjnoealnfndnagc).

Whenever you'll visit a repository on Github, it will open a sidebar with a file tree which will help you navigate easily in the contents!

You can also go in your github account to Settings > Applications and generate an App Token which will enable Octotree to work in your private repositories.
